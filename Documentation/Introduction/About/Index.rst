What does it do?
----------------

This extension adds an access system for the file storage to TYPO3. By means of
this extension, private file stores are supplemented with finely granulated
access for frontend users.

Access can be defined per file store and/or per folder.

A restricted access is responded to by a 403 error, so you can simply add your
403 error handler to your site configuration to deal with this.
